        I like to travel anywhere and everywhere. Driving gives me a sense of freedom because it’s enjoyable already because of my interest in cars. Also, I can go anywhere and explore more parts of California and hopefully more. I’ve already taken my car to all my trips with my friends like Palm Springs or San Diego. There’s just something about traveling and exploring new places that amazes me. Going to Balboa Park in San Diego was jaw-dropping. The architecture of the place was amazing. It was almost as if I was driving into a medieval castle. I like to travel anywhere and everywhere. Driving gives me a sense of freedom because it’s enjoyable already because of my interest in cars.
